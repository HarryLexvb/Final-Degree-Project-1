# Comparative Analysis of Time Series Prediction Techniques

## Repository Description

This repository meticulously documents the evolution of the project from its initial conception to its completion. The main objective is to replicate and contrast two specific techniques for solving a defined problem, ensuring that the results obtained maintain significant agreement with those presented in the reference article.

## Research Context

The research context focuses on the challenge of long-term time series prediction. While the original article presents an exhaustive comparative analysis of multiple techniques, our research focuses on a more limited comparative study, examining two of these methodologies in depth.

## Implementation and Modifications

In the implementation process, selective modifications have been made to the original source code. These adaptations have been carefully designed to facilitate the execution of the relevant experiments, maintaining the methodological integrity and validity of the results obtained.
